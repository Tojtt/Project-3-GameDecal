Fortune Teller: Hello dear, I sensed you would be here when I felt my secondary moon fall out of balance. 
Fortune Teller: Would you like your fortune told?
-> Not really.

-> Umm...Sure, I guess.
    <<set $response to 1>>
-> Uh, what?
    <<set $response to 2>>

<<if $response == 0>>
    Fortune Teller: Alright, but your moons have retrograded behind Jupiter! Come find me again so I can guide you.  
<<elseif $response == 1>>
    Fortune Teller: Wonderful, come inside. 
<<else>>
    Fortune Teller: I can predict the future. Come in, I've been waiting for you.
    -> No, thank you.
        <<set $response to 0>>
    -> Okay then.
        <<set $response to 1>>
